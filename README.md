created a full-stack event management application using Node.js, MongoDB, and React. RESTful APIs were created to facilitate smooth data transfer between the server and front end.

• Added admin capabilities that allow for the insertion, deletion, and alteration of event details. developed user features that allow you to browse events by city and type, and view all events that are accessible. added a "add-to-cart" function that enables customers to buy additional tickets.

• Added a checkout procedure that asks users for their credit card information and billing address. added the option to pay with PayPal as a backup payment method. Users who successfully complete a purchase get an email with a special QR code that allows them to enter the event hall.
